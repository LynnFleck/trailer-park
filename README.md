# The Trailer Park

## Problem Statement:

Netflix’s recommender system is hit or miss – and let’s face it: mostly a miss. (Partly caused by all of the anime films watched by one of the nine friends who share your account.)  
[[APP NAME!]] is a social Movie/TV library that allows you to easily find what you want to watch next through a constantly improving, hyper-personalized playlist of entertainment suggestions based on your preferences, as well as those of the friends you follow.  Sit back and watch your suggestions seamlessly loop through a tailored playlist of trailers that you can add to your Watchlist with just a click. Keep your Favorites organized with multiple Watchlists based on categories of your choosing. Find the link to watch plus full details of every Favorite added to your Watchlist.

### Solution:
- Follow your favorite TV/filmbuff friends so when you're looking for something to watch, go to one place to find recommendations.

### Problems:
- Always looking for stuff to watch
- Don't want to sift through reviews
- Want credibility from your choice of credible sources
- And don't want to be the last one in your group to watch something
- Visual playlist/radio of trailers
  - Like trailers before a movie
- Where can you find it?
